        <p><strong>Dr. Stephanie Billingham, Psychotherapist</strong><br />
            Welcome to My Practice.</p>
        <p>Over the years as a therapist, I&#8217;ve helped people create a life that is more content and
            fulfilling. I work
            with couples, adults, adolescents, families and children. Whenever I help a child, I involve the
            parents.</p>
        <p>Some of the concerns and struggles that people come to therapy seeking help for include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>stress management</li>
            <li>trauma</li>
            <li>feelings of depression and anxiety</li>
            <li>relationship difficulties</li>
            <li>eating issues</li>
            <li>low self esteem</li>
            <li>grief and loss</li>
            <li>a sense of hopelessness and despair</li>
            <li>parenting assistance</li>
            <li>PTSD</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Talking together in a non-judgmental way offers an
            understanding of how these concerns and struggles came about
            and can lead to better ways of coping with them.</p>
        <p>My extensive psychotherapy training has taught me to listen carefully and with compassion, and to be
            guided by the wishes and needs of each person who comes to see me.</p>
        <p>Whatever concerns or issues you may have, my approach is to work with you in a supportive, interactive
            way to help you change patterns that are not working for you.</p>
        <p>My office is located in South Easton, MA, convenient to the towns of Easton, North Easton, Taunton,
            Abington,
            Attleboro, Mansfield, Norton, Brockton, the Bridgewaters, Canton, Foxboro, Raynham, Dighton, Assonet,
